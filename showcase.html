<h3>Rainstick</h3>
<p>
Rainstick is an audio reactive application I made with <a href="http://b2renger.github.io/">b2renger</a>. We decided to make it to serve several goals : First because it is funny and it was something b2renger and I wanted to do some days. Second it was created as a showcase of the <a href="https://github.com/mgsx-dev/gdx-pd">gdx-pd</a> project we made (aka Puredata extension for libGDX). And finally it was a good use case for KIT.
</p>
<p>
It is based on Box2D for physics and the first need was to manually create/edit some Box2D shapes for each rainstick. Another need was to easily tweak both physical properties and audio procedural engine accordinaly. These kind of tweaking can takes a lot of time and experience give us interesting things : KIT speed up everythings, It took less than a day to have a full functional prototype of the final application including physics, audio. Second obvious thing, It tooks time to properly tweak both physical and audio settings but KIT editor infrastructure helps us a lot. Finalization (shaders, screen workflow, ...) was easy and the whole project take us less than 4 days each.

The first video was made by Google and may be published soon on android experiment. The second shows how to create new rainstick using the rainstick editor (aka KIT + the rainstick plugin). It gives an overview of the first KIT UI version.

<h3>OpenWorld</h3>
<p>
OpenWorld is a work in progress game I'm working on. This is a survivor game in a 3D environment.
