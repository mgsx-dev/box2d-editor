# Who is behind KIT ?

KIT is an Open Source project founded and maintain by me [MGSX](http://www.mgsx.net). I'm working wih LibGDX since few years now, contributing to the project sometimes and amon other things published a Puredata extension [gdx-pd](https://github.com/mgsx-dev/gdx-pd). I'm not pretending to be a game programming guru but I have some skills.

# Motivation

The origin of this project is a long story, I'll try to shorten it a little, if you have time you can read this.

About a year ago, I wanted to create a simple 2D platformer with LibGDX. First considerations was tooling : [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/) was an obvious choice to speed up level design and Box2D for collision detection and few physics was obvious as well. But after some research I didn't found a good free Box2D editor : most of them are not maintained anymore and the others are not free. 

I then decided to create my own Box2D editor based on LibGDX. At this time I was interested by ECS and I had the idea to prototype a tiny ECS based game editor come up, this is when KIT story begun.

The first results was promising and the more I implemented features the more I said to myself (and I continue to it every day) : there is no way back, I couldn't create a game with LibGDX anymore without it. Then I made lot of POCs of different games and every time the result was impressive in term of productiveness, modularity, reusability... Some of this POCs became true game projects.

Then I took a little time to think, look over other engines like Unity and UnrealEngine to imagine the futur of KIT. While KIT is at its first steps I'm confident with its design. It conforted me in the "Framework instead of engine" concept. So at this milestone my questions were : Do I have enough knowledges, time, skills, energy to maintain such a wide monster ? Answer is in the question so my approach is to focus on the core and put all plugin/extension stuff on the side, idea is "I publish the core" and all other stuff are "use it at your own risks". Idea is to provide a framework not a solution, developers could implements their own plugins.

At this time KIT still a work in progress project, I tested it over side projects and results was more than I expected. I think it's time to communicate about it to push it further or at least publish my work for the posterity :-).

Thanks for reading.
